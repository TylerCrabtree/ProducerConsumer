Description:
This is an implementation of a Producer-Consumer problem. Using Pthread creation and synchronization to form a relationship between producers that creates items and consumers that consume these items from a buffer. This can be described further by the Programming Project 3 in the book Operating Systems Concepts (9th edition).

Run Description:
1. Ensure you have pro.c and buffer.h in the same directory.
2. Type the command "gcc -o pro.c" to compile 
3. Type "./pro <sleepTime> <producers> <consumers>‚Äù
4. An example would be "./pro 10 10 10"
5. The program should depict a producer consumer relationship to the terminal.
